Audio Refinement and Transformations is a comprehensive

project that addresses the dual challenges of effective noise re-
moval and creative voice transformation in audio recordings.

Unwanted noise poses a significant barrier to audio quality,
while the potential for unique voice transformations remains

largely unexplored. Our motivation is to develop a holistic so-
lution that integrates classical techniques for noise removal and

subsequently unleashes creative possibilities in voice transfor-
mation.
